# Technological-Showdown: Innovation Infusion


A programming competition where software engineers compete in speed between low-code/no-code VS traditional programming.

**General Description:**  
The competition lasts for a total of 4 hours, with at least two participants/teams - one focusing on low-code/no-code solutions and the other on traditional programming - solving given tasks. The competition consists of two 1-hour programming sessions followed by evaluation and discussion sessions.

**Rules:**  
**1. General Organization of the Competition:**  
- The competition lasts for a total of 4 hours.
- Each participant/team solves 2 tasks.
- Each task's programming session lasts for 1 hour, followed by a 1-hour evaluation and discussion period.
- Programming occurs simultaneously, with both participants/teams working concurrently.
- Any technical issues must be reported immediately.
- Participants are responsible for their own hardware and software licenses.
- Participants should not be disturbed during programming sessions. (every second counts!)

**2. Tasks:**  
- Each participant/team submits one task they have solved within 1 hour.
- Tasks must not contain restrictive conditions, such as specific database usage requirements, etc.
- The opposing participant/team must accept the task at least 2 weeks before the competition.
- Questions regarding the tasks can be asked before the competition.
- It is advisable to solve the tasks before the competition.

**3. Programming:**  
- Copying code is prohibited, except for URLs, certificates, and passwords.
- Note-taking or using cheat sheets is allowed.
- Using AI is permitted, but copying AI prompts is prohibited.
- Open-source components may be used, but self-prescribed components are not allowed.
- Questions are not to be answered during the programming session.

**4. Visibility:**  
- The entire programming process is displayed in real-time on a large screen for other participants and spectators to follow.
- The evaluation process is public and visible on the large screen.

**5. Evaluation and Discussion:**  
- After each programming session, results are reviewed, discussed, and evaluated by all participants.
- Each participant/team submits their solution with explanations for evaluation.
- Approximately 1 hour is allotted for evaluation and discussion.

**6. Conclusion of the Competition:**  
- The competition ends after the evaluation and discussion of the second task.
- No winner is declared; the emphasis is on learning and sharing experiences.

**Note:**  
This competition is an excellent opportunity to showcase skills in both low-code/no-code and traditional programming, while also encouraging creativity and innovation.
